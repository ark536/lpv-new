break down each part of the graph implementation in the provided C++ code, including the header files, the Graph class, and the main function.

Header Files
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>
#include <omp.h>
iostream: This header file provides basic input and output services for C++ programs. It's used here for console input and output (cout and cin).
vector: This header file provides the implementation of the std::vector class, which is a dynamic array that can resize itself automatically.
queue: This header file provides the implementation of the std::queue class, which is a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.
stack: This header file provides the implementation of the std::stack class, which is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
omp.h: This header file is specific to OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) and provides functions and macros for parallel programming using OpenMP directives.
Graph Class
cpp
Copy code


class Graph {
    int V;
    vector<vector<int>> adj;

public:
    Graph(int V) : V(V), adj(V) {}

    void addEdge(int u, int v) {
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u); // For undirected graph
    }

    void parallelBFS(int start) {
        // Function definition...
    }

    void parallelDFS(int start) {
        // Function definition...
    }
};


class Graph: This defines a class named Graph which represents a graph.
int V: This member variable represents the number of vertices in the graph.
vector<vector<int>> adj: This is an adjacency list representation of the graph. It's a vector of vectors, where each element is a vector containing the neighbors of a vertex.
Graph(int V): This is the constructor of the Graph class, which initializes the graph with V vertices.
void addEdge(int u, int v): This function adds an undirected edge between vertices u and v.
void parallelBFS(int start): This function performs parallel Breadth-First Search starting from the vertex start.
void parallelDFS(int start): This function performs parallel Depth-First Search starting from the vertex start.


Main Function
cpp
Copy code


int main() {
    Graph g(6);
    g.addEdge(0, 1);
    g.addEdge(0, 2);
    g.addEdge(1, 3);
    g.addEdge(1, 4);
    g.addEdge(2, 5);

    cout << "BFS traversal: ";
    g.parallelBFS(0);
    cout << endl;

    cout << "DFS traversal: ";
    g.parallelDFS(0);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}


int main(): This is the entry point of the program.
Graph g(6): This creates a graph g with 6 vertices.
g.addEdge(u, v): This adds edges to the graph.
cout << "BFS traversal: ": This prints a message indicating the BFS traversal is being printed.
g.parallelBFS(0): This initiates the parallel BFS traversal from vertex 0.
cout << "DFS traversal: ": This prints a message indicating the DFS traversal is being printed.
g.parallelDFS(0): This initiates the parallel DFS traversal from vertex 0.
return 0;: This statement indicates that the program has executed successfully.
