Sure, I'll provide you with a C++ code implementation for parallel Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms using OpenMP. First, let's define the problem:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): It is a graph traversal algorithm that starts at a specified node and explores all its neighboring nodes at the present depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

Depth-First Search (DFS): It is another graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

We'll implement these algorithms for both trees and undirected graphs. For simplicity, I'll provide the code for an undirected graph.


Explanation:

We define a Graph class to represent the graph.
The addEdge function is used to add edges between vertices.
The parallelBFS function implements parallel Breadth-First Search using OpenMP.
The parallelDFS function implements parallel Depth-First Search using OpenMP.
In both BFS and DFS functions, OpenMP's pragma omp parallel for directive is used to parallelize the traversal of adjacent vertices.
To compile and run the code, make sure you have OpenMP enabled in your compiler. For GCC, you can compile it using:

g++ -fopenmp your_file.cpp -o output

Then run the executable ./output.

This code should give you a basic understanding of how to implement parallel BFS and DFS using OpenMP in C++. Feel free to ask if you have any questions!
